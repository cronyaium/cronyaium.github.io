* Huazhong University of Science and Technology University, 2021-2025(estimated)

Overall GPA:4.6/5.0 or 91.6/100

ranking: 1/56 in grade, 1/29 in class

National Scholarship in China, 2023

Projects
======
**CMU 15-445 BUSTUB**
BUSTUB is a database developed based on C++ that supports simple SQL operations.
  
The underlying design is BufferPool based on LRU, and all page operations are performed on BufferPool. At the same time, an scalable hash table is implemented in the Buffer Pool.

Statement execution adopts the volcano model, supporting SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE, JOIN, AGGREGATION, LIMIT, and DISTINCT operations. Join has two implementations: Nested Loop Join and Hash Join.

Concurrency control adopts 2PL design to achieve three isolation levels: RU, RC, and RR.

Implement a global Lock Manager to manage R/W locks, and deadlock processing is based on the wound-wait algorithm in deadlock prevention.
